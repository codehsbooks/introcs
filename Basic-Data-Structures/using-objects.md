## Using Objects

We want to use objects in situations where we want to associate one thing with another. For example, in the previous section, using an object we associated words with definitions. Now let's explore other situations where objects would be useful.

Let's say that we want to create a menu for a restaurant. Since we want to associate menu items with their respective prices. Now let's create a menu object and add soda, hot dogs, hamburgers, and french fries.

```
var menu = {};
menu["Soda"] = 1;
menu["Hot dog"] = 2;
menu["Hamburger"] = 3;
menu["French fries"] = 2;
```

Now, our menu looks something like this:

|ITEM | PRICE|
|---|---|
|Soda | 1 |
|Hot dog | 2 |
|Hamburger | 3 |
|French fries | 2 |
