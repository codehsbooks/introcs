<h1>Intro to Lists and Arrays</h1>

Storing, accessing, and manipulating lists of data is an essential and fundamental facet of programming. The most basic storage type is called an <b>array</b>. 

Arrays are ordered lists. Each item in the array is called a <b>member</b>, and each member's position is called its <b>index</b>.

<h3>The Array Index</h3>
<u>The first element in an array corresponds to index 0.</u> Each subsequent element's index corresponds to the element's distance from the first element.

Consider the following scenario. I have an array consisting of the following elements, in order: "California", "Wyoming", "Vermont", "Wisconsin". 

The elements are indexed as such:
<nl>0 -- "California"
<nl>1 -- "Wyoming"
<nl>2 -- "Vermont"
<nl>3 -- "Wisconsin"


<h3>Special Note</h3>
Arrays on most programming platforms have finite length. That means that the number of elements in the array cannot differ from the number of elements at the time that the array was created. <u>This rule does not apply on the CodeHS platform.</u> Our arrays have mutable length, meaning you can add and remove elements as you wish.
