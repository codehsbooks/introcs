# Mouse Click Events

Sometimes we want the user to be able to interact with our programs.  We've seen how to do this by asking questions, but suppose we want the user to pick  location on the screen.  It'd be annoying for the user to have to figure out the X and Y coordinates of the spot.  This is one instance where using Mouse Click Events comes in handy.  All the user has to do is click on the chosen spot, and the program gets all of the information it needs.
