# Mouse Click Events

Sometimes we want the user to be able to interact with our programs.  We've seen how to do this by asking questions, but suppose we want the user to pick  location on the screen.  It'd be annoying for the user to have to figure out the X and Y coordinates of the spot.  This is one instance where using Mouse Click Events comes in handy.  All the user has to do is click on the chosen spot, and the program gets all of the information it needs.


## What are Events?
In spoken English, events usually refer to special gatherings, like sporting events or parties.  In computer science, events are actions that occur that the program needs or wants to respond to.  Here, we are specifically talking about mouse events.  Mouse events are "triggered" or "fired" whenever the user does something with the mouse, such as moving the mouse or clicking the mouse.

## Responding to Events
To respond to an event, the program has to set up a special method to listen for the events.
