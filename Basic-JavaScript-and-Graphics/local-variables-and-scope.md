#Local Variables and Scope



###What are Local Variables?
 You have already been using local variables! Local variables are variables that are declared using the keyword ```var```. Since we always declare variables with the keyword ```var```, why aren't all variables local variables? The thing that makes local variables *local* is that they are declared *inside* of a function or loop.  Since they are declared inside of the function, they belong only to that one function and no other functions.  It's like calling someone who was born in  particular town a local (or native) to the town.  You can think of a function as a town whose people are all of the variables that are declared inside of it.  Unlike real people, however, our variable people don't ever move from their town.
