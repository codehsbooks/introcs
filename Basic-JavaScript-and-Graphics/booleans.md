#Booleans
How do we say that it is sunny outside (true)? Or that the user is logged in to our program? Booleans are the solution to these questions. 

###What are booleans?
A boolean refers to a value that is true or false. Those are the only values of a boolean expression, and these are useful if we want to check if something is true or false.

###Meet George Boole
