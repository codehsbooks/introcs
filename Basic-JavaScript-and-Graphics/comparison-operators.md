# Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used when comparing two values against one another. The values being compared can be variables or static numbers. The result from doing such a comparison will yield either a **true** or **false** value. The table below lists each of the comparison operators:

|  Operator      |  Usage           |  
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| >              | Greater Than     |  
| <              | Less Than        |  
| >=             | Greater Than Or Equal To|  
| <=             | Less Than Or Equal To|   
| ==             | Equal To   |          
| !=             | Not Equal To |
