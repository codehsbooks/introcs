# If Statements

We use if statements to run a segment of code only if some condition first evaluates to true. An if statement takes the following form:

```
if (condition) {
    //Segment of code that will run given the condition is true
}
```

## Conditions

In the previous two chapters, you learned all about logical operators and comparison operators. These form the basis for writing conditions in if statements. For example:

```
int x = 5;
if () {

}
```
