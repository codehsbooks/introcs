# If Statements

We use if statements to run a segment of code only if some boolean expression first evaluates to true. An if statement takes the following basic form:

```
if (boolean expression) {
    //Segment of code that will run given the boolean expression is true
}
```

If the boolean expression evaluates to false, nothing will happen. The code within the if statement is ignored. 

# If/Else Statements

We can add the **else** keyword to our if statements.
In this case, if the boolean expression in our if statement evaluates to false, the code within the **else** segment will run. If the boolean expression evaluates to true, the code within the if segment will run.

```
if (boolean expression) {
    //Segment of code that will run given the boolean expression is true
} else {
    //Segment of code that will run given the boolean expression is false
}
```

## Example Program

## Conditions

In the previous two chapters, you learned all about logical operators and comparison operators. These form the basis for writing conditions in if statements. For example:

```
int x = 5;
if () {

}
```
