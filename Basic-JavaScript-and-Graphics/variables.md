# Variables
Now that we've written our first program, let's look how we can further expand our programs by using variables.

### What Are Variables?
Variables in JavaScript are like little boxes where you can store values that you need later. Every variable has a name and a value.   

For example, suppose you are going to the hardware store to buy nails because you are building a bookshelf.  However, since you are going to the store at the end of the day, you decide to write down how many nails you need from the store.  Your piece of paper might look like 

```
Number of Nails I Need
53 
```

This piece of paper is kind of like a variable.  The paper is like the box.  This box has a name, "Number of Nails I Need".  It stores a value, "53".  You can easily refer to this piece of paper to check the value it has written on it.

Let's look more closely at how variables work.

### Declaring vs. Initializing
You declare a variable by using the keyword ```var```.  For example, let's make a variable for the number of nails we need.

```
var numNails;
```

Now we have an empty storage place where can store the number of nails.  This is like having an empty sheet of paper. This variable does not have a value yet.  We call this "uninitialized".  The variable ```numNails``` merely has a name.

If we want to declare the variable and initialize it, we can write the following

```
var numNails = 53;
```

Now we have a variable named ```numNails``` with the value 53.  We have essentially put a 53 in the box named ```numNails```.

Let's do a quick recap.  Declaring a variable means creating and naming an empty box to put things in later.  Initializing a variable means creating, naming, and filling a box.
